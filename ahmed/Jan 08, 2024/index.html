      The <strong>chicken</strong> (<strong><em>Gallus domesticus</em></strong>) is a domesticated species that arose from
      the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast Asia. They have also
      partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
      junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock
      are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans
      keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
      eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting,
      which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat
      are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
