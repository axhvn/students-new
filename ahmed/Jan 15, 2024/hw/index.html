      The <strong>chicken (Gallus domesticus)</strong> is a domesticated species
      that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast Asia. They
      have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the
      grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl). <sup>[1]</sup>
      <strong>Rooster</strong> and <strong>cock</strong> are terms for adult
      male birds, and a younger male may be called a <strong>cockerel</strong>.
      A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
      a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a <strong>pullet</strong>.
      Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
      meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for
      cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
      domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, <sup>[2]</sup> up from more
      than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any
      other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth,
      folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within
      South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, <sup>[3]</sup> but the clade
      found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from
      the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the
      Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th
      century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
      the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
      Thutmose III. <sup>[4][5][6]</sup> They are known in ancient Greece from
      the 5th century BC. <sup>[7][8]</sup>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster, and
      an adult female is called a hen. <sup>[9][10]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>Other terms are:</p>

      <li><em>Chick:</em> a young chicken <sup>[13]</sup></li>
      <li>
        <em>Chook</em> /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)
        <sup>[14]</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Cockerel:</em> a young male chicken less than a year old

      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Yardbird:</em> a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)
        <sup>[19]</sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
      <sup>[20]</sup> In fact, chicken <br />
      was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
      bird.[when?] <br />
      In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts,
      chicken as a species are <br />
      typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl. <sup> [21] </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term
      for the species (e.g. "a cooked chook" or "she keeps chooks"); which
      enables chicken<br />
      to commonly retain its original <br />
      sense of a young or recently hatched bird. Chick is then rarely used to
      mean chicken, but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's <br />
      "Sense 1b" viz. the young of any bird.
    </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e., a roosting bird)
      originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
      sexual <br />
      connotation of the original English cock, <sup> [22][23][24] </sup> and is
      widely used throughout North America. <br />
      Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.
      <sup> [25] </sup>
    </p>
    <h2>Biology and Habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores.[26] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, <br />
      and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[27] or sometimes young
      mice.[28]
    </p>
    <p>
      The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[29]
      The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years <br />
      according to Guinness World Records.[30]
    </p>
    <p>
      Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage
      of long, flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their <br />
      necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter,
      bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some
      breeds,<br />
      such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck
      feathers, the same colour as the hen's.<br />
      Identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually by the
      development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain
      hybrids,<br />
      the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).
    </p>
    <p>
      Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or
      cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks
      called wattles.<br />
      Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat
      are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and
      combs, <br />
      but in most breeds, these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard'
      is a mutation found in several chicken breeds that causes extra feathering
      under the <br />
      chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[31]
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
      lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances,
      <br />
      such as over fences or into trees <br />
      (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly
      to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived
      danger.
    </p>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <p><strong>Social behaviour</strong></p>
    <p><em>See also: Empathy in chickens</em></p>
    <p>
      Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
      communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.<br />
      Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
      pecking order, <br />
      with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting
      locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary
      disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
      established.<br />
      Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to
      fighting and injury.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At
      least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by
      hens.[32][33][34]<br />
      If a chicken is threatened by predators, stressed, or is sick, it may puff
      up its feathers.[35]
    </p>
    <p><strong>Vocalizations</strong></p>
    <p>
      When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He
      does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
      the food.<br />
      This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks
      and encourage them to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a
      territorial signal to other roosters.[36] However,<br />
      roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and also to call their chicks.
      Chickens also give different warning calls when<br />
      they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[37]
    </p>
    <p><strong>Crowing</strong></p>

        rhyme, see Cock a doodle doo.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although
      it is possible for a hen to crow as well,<br />
      crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs
      of being a rooster.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <p>
      Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries,
      such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[38] the United States,
      Indonesia and Japan. The oldest<br />
      contests are held with longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the
      duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain
      time is measured.
