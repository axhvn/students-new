          Reward good behavior immediately and consistently for best results.
          <br>
          Avoid harsh punishments or yelling, as this can damage your bond and
          <br>
          create fear or anxiety in your dog.

        <li>
          Start Early and Be Consistent: Begin training your Lab as early as

          <br>
          learning.

          provide them with ample physical and mental stimulation through

          walks, playtime, and fetch.

          They also love to chew, so offer them plenty of safe chew toys to
          <br>
          prevent them from destroying your belongings. Labs can be prone to
          <br>
          food-related excitement, so practice impulse control training with
          <br>
          commands like "leave it" and "drop it." Seek Professional Help if
          <br>
          Needed: Don't hesitate to seek guidance from a professional dog
          <br>
          trainer if you encounter challenges or have specific concerns. They
          <br>

          <br>
          effectively.
