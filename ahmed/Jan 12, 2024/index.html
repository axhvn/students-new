      <strong>World War II</strong> or the <strong>Second World War</strong
      >[b] was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The
      vast majority of the world's countries, including all the great powers,
      fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the
      Axis. Many participating countries invested all available economic,
      industrial, and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the
      distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a
      major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and
      delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was by far
      the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million fatalities.
      Millions died due to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as
      starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany,
      Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime tribunals were conducted
      against German and Japanese leaders.

      World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939[1][2] with the German
      invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war
      on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of
      the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7
      July 1937,[3][4] or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19
      September 1931.[5][6] Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor,
      who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies
      occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.[7]
      Other theorized starting dates for World War II include the Italian
      invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.[8] The British historian Antony
      Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol
      fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from
      May to September 1939.[9] Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start
      or prelude to World War II.[10][11]

      The exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It was
      generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15
      August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2
      September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty
      between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.[12] A 1990 treaty
      regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West
      Germany to take place and resolved most post–World War II issues.[13] No
      formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever
      signed,[14] although the state of war between the two countries was
      terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also
      restored full diplomatic relations between them.[15]

        Reparations were exacted from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and
        Bulgaria using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. The USSR also
        instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favour the
        country. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the
        satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian
        Mark Kramer concludes: "The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe
        to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the
        first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total
        aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall
        Plan."
